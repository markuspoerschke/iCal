## X-PUBLISHED-TTL

The [`X-PUBLISHED-TTL`](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee178699(v=exchg.80).aspx) property specifies a suggested iCalendar file download frequency for clients and servers with sync capabilities.

Use the `setPublishedTTL()` method with a [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations)-formatted string to set this duration.

```php
use Eluceo\iCal\Domain\Entity\Calendar;

$calendar = new Calendar();
// set the duration to 2 hours
$calendar->setPublishedTTL('PT2H')
```
