The package can be installed using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org).

Either the package can be required through the command line, like this:

```sh
composer require eluceo/ical
```

Or the dependency can be added to the `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "eluceo/ical": "^2"
    }
}
```
