This package offers a abstraction layer for creating iCalendars. The output will
follow [RFC 5545](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5545.txt) as best as possible.

The following components are supported at this time:

* VCALENDAR
* VEVENT
* VALARM
* VTIMEZONE

## Requirements

**PHP** ```>=7.0```


## Installation

You can install this package by using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org), running this command:

```sh
composer require eluceo/ical
```
Link to Packagist: https://packagist.org/packages/eluceo/ical

## Usage

### Basic Usage

#### 1. Create a Calendar object

```PHP
$vCalendar = new \Eluceo\iCal\Component\Calendar('www.example.com');
```

#### 2. Create an Event object

```PHP
$vEvent = new \Eluceo\iCal\Component\Event();
```

#### 3. Add your information to the Event

```PHP
$vEvent
    ->setDtStart(new \DateTime('2012-12-24'))
    ->setDtEnd(new \DateTime('2012-12-24'))
    ->setNoTime(true)
    ->setSummary('Christmas')
;
```

#### 4. Add Event to Calendar

```PHP
$vCalendar->addComponent($vEvent);
```

#### 5. Set HTTP-headers

```PHP
header('Content-Type: text/calendar; charset=utf-8');
header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="cal.ics"');
```

#### 6. Send output

```PHP
echo $vCalendar->render();
```

### Timezone support

This package supports three different types of handling timezones:

#### 1. UTC (default)

In the default setting, UTC/GMT will be used as Timezone. The time will be formated as following:

```
DTSTART:20121224T180000Z
```

#### 2. Use explicit timezone

You can use an explicit timezone by calling `$vEvent->setUseTimezone(true);`. The timezone of your
`\DateTime` object will be used. In this case the non-standard field "X-WR-TIMEZONE" will be used.
Be awre that this is a simple solution which is not supported by all calendar clients.
The output will be as following:

```
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20121224T180000
```

#### 3. Use explicit timezone with definition

You can use an explicit timezone and define it using `Timezone()` and `TimezoneRule()` (see example5.php).
The timezone of your `\DateTime` object will be used. The output will be as following:

```
BEGIN:VTIMEZONE
TZID:Europe/Berlin
X-LIC-LOCATION:Europe/Berlin
BEGIN:DAYLIGHT
TZOFFSETFROM:+0100
TZOFFSETTO:+0200
DTSTART:19810329T030000
RRULE:FREQ=YEARLY;INTERVAL=1;BYMONTH=3;BYDAY=-1SU
END:DAYLIGHT
BEGIN:STANDARD
TZOFFSETFROM:+0200
TZOFFSETTO:+0100
DTSTART:19961027T030000
RRULE:FREQ=YEARLY;INTERVAL=1;BYMONTH=10;BYDAY=-1SU
END:STANDARD
END:VTIMEZONE
...
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20121224T180000
```

#### 4. Use locale time

You can use local time by calling `$vEvent->setUseUtc(false);`. The output will be:

```
DTSTART:20121224T180000
```
